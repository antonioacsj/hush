rash - Rush Hash: A more fast hash algoritm.

Due a bigger and bigger files, its necessary update the way that hash files are calculated. In this approach, we try maximize the cpu availables in the computer, to use
paralell hash computation of blocks of file, and then, hash the thas of blocks, like in a blockchain.

The final hash is the rash code of that file. 

Actually, the r-sha256 is supported, but we can have r-sha512, etc.




The algoritm take parameters: blockSize, that is the size that the original file will be breaked to hash computation.
